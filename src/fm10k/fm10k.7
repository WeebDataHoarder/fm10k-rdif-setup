.SH NAME
fm10k \-This file describes the Intel(R) Ethernet Switch
Host Interface Driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PD 0.4v
modprobe fm10k [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]
.PD 1v
.SH DESCRIPTION
This driver is intended for \fB2.6.32\fR and newer kernels. A version of the driver may already be included by your distribution and/or the kernel.org kernel.

This driver includes support for any 64 bit Linux supported system, x86_64, PPC64, ARM, etc.
.LP
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of the drivers.


For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to
use with Linux.
.SH Jumbo Frames
.LP
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to a value larger than the default value of 1500.

Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size. For example, enter the following where X is the interface number:

# ifconfig ethX mtu 9000 up

Alternatively, you can use the ip command as follows:

# ip link set mtu 9000 dev ethX
# ip link set up dev ethX

.LP
NOTE: The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 15342. This value coincides with the maximum Jumbo Frames size of 15364 bytes.

NOTE: This driver will attempt to use multiple page sized buffers to receive each jumbo packet. This should help to avoid buffer starvation issues when allocating receive packets.

NOTE: Packet loss may have a greater impact on throughput when you use jumbo frames. If you observe a drop in performance after enabling jumbo frames, enabling flow control may mitigate the issue.
See the section "Jumbo Frames" in the Readme.
