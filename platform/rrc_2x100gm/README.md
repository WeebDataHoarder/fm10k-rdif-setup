# Silicom PE3100G2DQIRM-QX4

## Notes
* This card requires at least a x16 PCIe slot bifurcated into two x8 slots. The management port is located on PEP 6 and having a single x8 makes it not accesible.
* The daughter card is not required to function properly. In fact, you might even be able to throw it onto another host!
